Use Case: Login 
The system loads and displays a menu with two choices
login and exit. When the customer types the number 
associated with the login use case, a new screen is 
displayed. The customer is asked to enter its username 
and password. If the first attempt failed, a last attempt is
allowed. After the last attempt, the customer is taken back 
to the first screen or its customer view with a summary of 
its account is displayed.
